Let's have a maximum queue size of 4
Each student has a name and an ID number
We have a circular queue of students
    Check if it's empty
    Check if it's full
     Add a new student to the end of the queue
     Remove a student from the front of the queue
     Get the first student in the queue
     Show all students in the queue
Each student added will have a unique ID starting from 2210
We have a function called Ch that does the following
     Keeps track of registered students in a list
     Manages a waiting list of students
     Repeats until the user decides to exit:
      Provides options for the user to choose from
       Reads the user's choice
              Depending on the choice
            Adds a student to the waiting list
             Registers a student if there are any in the waiting list
             Shows all registered students
             Shows all students in the waiting list
             Exits the program

Finally we have a main function that starts the program by calling Ch
